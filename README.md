# AI Sports Coach Assistant (AISCA) - README

## Overview

The AI Sports Coach Assistant (AISCA) is an emerging platform designed to provide personalized sports coaching with the assistance of machine learning technologies. The initial phase of the AISCA project focuses on the generation of customized training plans, leveraging user data and wearable device inputs as the foundation for more sophisticated functionalities.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a structured directory layout designed to facilitate modular development:

- **aisca/main.py**: This is the main entry point for the application where the execution begins. It initializes the user and wearable data, generates a training plan, and displays performance tracking data.

- **aisca/models/**: This directory contains all model-related modules.
  - **training_plan.py**: Handles the creation of personalized training plans based on sport, skill level, available equipment, and fitness goals.

- **aisca/utils/**: Contains utility modules needed across the application.
  - **data_loader.py**: Responsible for loading mock user profile data and wearable data, simulating inputs from potential data sources in the future.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the external Python libraries required for the project. Currently, it is empty, as the initial code does not necessitate any additional packages.

## Main Components

### 1. Personalized Training Plan

The `TrainingPlan` class within `training_plan.py` models the logic to generate simple, personalized training plans. The generation process is based on basic user information to produce a descriptive training outline. In this phase, it serves as a structural placeholder for more complex plan creation in future iterations.

### 2. Mock Data Loading

For demonstration purposes, `data_loader.py` simulates the acquisition of user and wearable data. This component aims to mimic potential data input methodologies, which may consist of API calls or database queries in real-world implementations.

### 3. Application Execution

The `main.py` script forms the crux of the applicationâ€™s workflow. It encompasses initializing user and wearable data, invoking the training plan generation, and printing out the simulated performance tracking metrics.

## Future Development

This foundational codebase sets up AISCA for further enhancement, such as:

- Integrating advanced machine learning models for real-time plan adjustments.
- Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive, tailor-fitted responses to user queries.
- Enhancing performance tracking with real-time data from connected wearable devices.
- Expanding the application to include more sports, customized drills, and rehabilitation exercises.

AISCA is designed to gradually evolve into a feature-rich virtual assistant for sports coaching, offering athletes an innovative and comprehensive tool for optimizing their training routines.
